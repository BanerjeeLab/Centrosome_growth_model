# Centrosome_growth_model
This repository contain the codes used to study size regulation of centrosomes during centrosome maturation before cell division. Please see the corresponding [publication](https://duckduckgo.com) for more detals. We used these codes to simulate stochastic growth of centrosomes in a cell with finite amount of building blocks. It includes codes for the different models used such as autocatalytic and catalytic growth etc as we describe below.
